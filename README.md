## About

**betteralign** is a tool to detect structs that would use less memory if their fields were sorted and optionally sort such fields.

This is a fork of an official Go [fieldalignment](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/fieldalignment) tool and vast majority of the alignment code has remained the same. There are however some notable changes:

- skips over generated files, either files with `_generated.go` suffix or due to package-level comment containing `Code generated by.. DO NOT EDIT.` string,
- skips over test files (files with `_test.go` suffix)
- doesn't lose comments (field comments, doc comments, floating comments or otherwise) but the comment position heuristics is still work in progress,
- does very reliable atomic file I/O with strong promise not to currupt and/or lose contents upon rewrite,
- has more thorough testing in regards to expected optimised vs golden results,
- integrates better with environments with restricted CPU or memory resources (Docker containers, K8s containers, LXC, LXD etc.).

Retaining comments has been done with using [DST](https://github.com/dave/dst) (Decorated Syntax Tree) with decorating regular AST. Sadly when using DST we cannot use "fix" mode with SuggestedFixes, but we have to print whole DST to retain decorations.

In case you are wondering why DST and not AST, in general sense AST does not [associate comments to nodes](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20744), but it holds fixed offsets. Original fieldalignment tool just erases all struct/field/floating comments due to this issue and while there is a CL with [a possible fix](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/429639), it's still a work in progress as of this time.

Let us also mention original projects handling this task and without which this derivative work wouldn't exist in the first place:

- [maligned](https://github.com/mdempsky/maligned) from **Matthew Dempsky**
- [structslop](https://github.com/orijtech/structslop) from **orijtech**

## Installation

There are two ways of installing betteralign:

### Manual:

Download your preferred flavor from [the releases](https://github.com/dkorunic/betteralign/releases) page and install manually, typically to `/usr/local/bin/betteralign`

### Using go install:

```shell
go install github.com/dkorunic/betteralign/cmd/betteralign@latest
```

## Usage

```shell
betteralign: find structs that would use less memory if their fields were sorted

Usage: betteralign [-flag] [package]

Flags:
  -apply
    	apply suggested fixes
  -generated_files
    	also check and fix generated files
  -test_files
    	also check and fix test files
```

To get all recommendations on your project:

```shell
betteralign ./...
```

To automatically fix your project files, while ignoring test and generated files:

```shell
betteralign -apply ./...
```

It is possible to include generated files and test files by enabling `generated_files` and/or `test_files` flags.
